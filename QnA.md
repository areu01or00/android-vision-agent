       │                     │                    │
       │                     ▼                    │
       │            ┌─────────────────┐           │
       └───────────►│  Decision       │◄──────────┘
                    │  Engine         │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Action         │
                    │  Execution      │

```python
from android_ai_agent import AndroidAgent, tasks

# Initialize the agent
agent = AndroidAgent(
    vision_model="gpt-4o",
    planning_model="gpt-4-turbo",
    use_kernel_tracing=True
)

# Define a cross-posting task
cross_post_task = tasks.social.CrossPostTask(
    source_app="instagram",
    target_app="twitter",
    content_type="image"
)

# Run the task
result = agent.execute_task(cross_post_task)
```

**Script-Based Approach:**
```python
from android_ai_agent import AndroidAgent
import json

# Load app configuration
with open("app_configs/instagram.json") as f:
    instagram_config = json.load(f)

# Execute the configured task
agent = AndroidAgent()
agent.load_app_config(instagram_config)
agent.execute_configured_task(task_config)
```

This approach would make it easy for users to create complex automation workflows without in-depth programming knowledge.

## Device Connectivity

### Q: Is it possible to use remote ADB instead of requiring a physical connection?

**A:** Yes, remote ADB is fully supported and would enhance your project's capabilities:

**How Remote ADB Works:**
ADB can operate over TCP/IP (Wi-Fi) instead of USB, allowing remote device control:
```
┌─────────────┐                  ┌─────────────┐
│             │                  │             │
│  Computer   │◄─── Wi-Fi ─────►│  Android    │
│  with Agent │     Network      │  Device     │
│             │                  │             │
└─────────────┘                  └─────────────┘
```

**Initial Setup (per device):**
```bash
# Connect the device via USB first
adb devices

# Enable TCP/IP mode on port 5555
adb tcpip 5555

# Find the device's IP address
adb shell ip addr show wlan0

# Disconnect USB and connect over network
adb connect DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS:5555
```

**Code Compatibility:**
Your existing ADB commands will work identically with remote connections - the ADB client handles connection details transparently.

**Enhanced Features Enabled:**
1. **Distributed Automation Farm** - Control multiple devices simultaneously from one server
2. **Cloud Deployment** - Run your agent on cloud infrastructure while devices are elsewhere
3. **Remote Management Dashboard** - Monitor and control automation remotely via web interface

**Technical Considerations:**
1. **Performance** - Slightly higher latency than USB connections
2. **Security** - Implement VPN or SSH tunneling for secure connections
3. **Stability** - Add connection monitoring and recovery mechanisms

**Library Integration:**
```python
class ADBConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, use_remote=False, device_ip=None, device_port=5555):
        self.use_remote = use_remote
        self.device_ip = device_ip
        self.device_port = device_port
        
    def initialize(self):
        if self.use_remote:
            self._setup_remote_connection()
        else:
            self._verify_usb_connection()
```

**Commercial Potential:**
Remote ADB capability significantly increases commercial viability:
1. **Managed Service** - Operate devices in your facility, sell access to the automation
2. **Remote Maintenance** - IT departments could automate tasks on employee devices
3. **Distributed Testing** - Test apps across multiple physical devices from one control point
4. **Content Production** - Schedule content creation and posting from anywhere

Remote ADB integration makes your Android AI Agent more versatile and commercially viable, opening up numerous deployment scenarios beyond requiring physical device connections.
